## Structs

A struct seems just like an object from other languages with some properties that you can define.  A simple shape from the example:

```go 
type Rectangle {
    Width float64
    Height float64
}
```

Structs can be passed to functions, I imagine also a return value (to be confirmed).

## Methods

Methods are very similar to functions but they are called by invokeing them on an instance of a particular type.

## Interfaces

Interfaces in got is a concept that I do not understand.

## Go tips

Apparently [table driven tests](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/TableDrivenTests) are a thing.  Useful to test various implementations of an interface.

Apparently anonymous structs are a thing.

Fields can be named.  In the example the named fields are in the test table but it's not clear if that can be done with other things.

This section has to be entirely reread.
